# My Custom WordPress Theme

This project was created to learn WordPress and PHP by building a custom theme. I followed an
online tutorial provided by Treehouse. Most of the CSS and Styling came with the tutorial but all wp functions and template hierarchy was created by myself.

* Fork and clone this repo
